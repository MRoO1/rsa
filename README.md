# RSA Implementation Using python3

RSA implementation. This repository contains a library with functions needed to encrypt/decrypt a message using RSA cryptography. Also, a script to test the methods implemented.


## Files

This repo has two files: rsa.py and tests.py. The first one contains all methods needed to implement a RSA encryption/decryption program. The second one implements a simple test to show how to use this library, generating keys, encoding a message, etc.

## Usage

You can use this library for your own application. But if you want to test it before (or just see the code working), run the tests.py script on a terminal:
```python
python3 tests.py
```
